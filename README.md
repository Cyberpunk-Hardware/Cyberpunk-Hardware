## What?
- 👋 @Cyberpunk-Hardware is mostly decentralised and self organising. It has a soul (strangely) and is looking to provide computers and freedom tech related hardware around the world. We are bitcoin friendly, fiat free and hopefully people friendly also. We want to create an open market where you can buy and sell equipment with trust and get good support from other humans. 

## Why?
- 👀 Interested in surviving without being consumed by the machine, but recognise that we need our own tech to defend ourselves.
- 🌱 Currently we are running nodes, creating fun websites, chating and showing off hacky bitcoin tech.
- 💞️ Looking to share and collaborate with bitcoin and lightning node builds, home servers, mesh networks, surveilance free technology, phones and communication, home miners.


- 📫 Reach out here, on telegrame, on nostr or on sphinxchat to get deeper. (All adminstrative tasks should currently be comunicated through Sphinxchat, github or gitbook.)

## How?
- Code projects start here in github, also we manage general operating tasks here. 
- Cocumentation projects specs instructions for DIY etc are put in the team library at gitbook cyberpunk-hardware.gitbook.io 
- Once comercialisable we can move things onto nostr stores or the websites cyberpunkhardware.co if we are all happy.
