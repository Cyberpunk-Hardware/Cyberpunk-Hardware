- 👋 @Cyberpunk-Hardware is a mostly decentralised and self organising group looking to provide computers and hardware for the bitcoin friendly, hopefully people friendly, but most likely digital and bionic future. We want to create an open market where you can buy equipment with trust and get good support.
- 👀 Interested in surviving without being consumed by the machine, but recognise that we need our own tech to defend ourselves...
- 🌱 Currently learning coding, creating fun websites and chating about hacky bitcoin tech...
- 💞️ Looking to collaborate on bitcoin and lightning node builds, home servers, mesh networks, surveilance free technology, phones and communication, home miners...
- 📫 Reach out here, on telegrame or on sphinxchat to get deeper. All adminstrative tasks should be comunicated through Sphinxchat, github or gitbook...


Cyberpunk Hardware is evolving and this is a living document amoung others created, reviewed and updated by our contributers.

Code projects start here in github, documentation is put in the team library at gitbook cyberpunk-hardware.gitbook.io, and we can move things onto the websites cyberpunkhardware.co if we are all happy.
