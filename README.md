- 👋 Hi, I’m @Cyberpunk-Hardware. I am a decentralised self organising group looking to provide computers and hardware for the bitcoin friendly, people friendly, but likely digital and bionic future. We want to create an open market where you can buy equipment with trust and get good support.
- 👀 I’m interested in surviving without being consumed by the machine, but recognise that we need our own tech to defend ourselves...
- 🌱 I’m currently learning coding...
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on bitcoin and lightning node builds, home servers, mesh networks, surveilance free technology, phones and communication, home miners...
- 📫 How to reach me on telegrame or on sphinxchat to get deeper. All adminstrative tasks should be comunicated through Shpinxchat or github...


Cyberpunk Hardware is supposed to be what we have here in this living document. 
If not then we need to talk about changing this
