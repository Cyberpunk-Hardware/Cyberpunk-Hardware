## What?
- 👋 @Cyberpunk-Hardware is anonymously founded, decentralised and self-organising.
- 🌱 We are just getting started and this is a living document created, reviewed, fixed and updated by our contributors (that's you) we are into open source.

- 🎢 The group is focused on freedom tech. We are bitcoin-friendly, fiat free and not bound by jurisdiction. We want to create an open market where you can buy and sell equipment, build trust and get good support from other enthusiastic humans. 

## Why?
- 👀 We are interested in being prepared and surviving without being consumed by the machine and recognise that we need our own tech to defend ourselves.
- 👾 Currently, we are running nodes, creating fun websites, running meetings online and IRL, chatting and showing off hacky bitcoin tech.
- 💞️ We want to share and collaborate with people and organisations who share our thinking. We like bitcoin lightning node builds, home servers, home miners, mesh networks, surveillance-free technology, phones and communication.

## When? Right now you can jump in
- 📫 Reach out here, on telegram discord or particularly on nostr 📣 our Gitea and Nextcloud to get deeper currently we also run weekly Hivechat.com meetups. 

## How it works?
- 💾 Code projects start here in Github (and Gitea mirrors),
- 💭 We share ideas and manage general operating tasks here, in Discord and NOSTR depending on the privacy wanted. 
- 📖 Documentation projects specs instructions etc are put in the LearnWiki repo and relevant Wikis. 
- 🚚 Once ready to go we can move things onto NOSTR stores or the websites <a href>cyberpunkhardware.co</a> and others in the webring if we are all reasonably happy.
